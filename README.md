# BurglarAlarmSystem
Team project in developing software for Burglar Alarm System.

# My contribution
Classes: Alarm, Communication, DoorSensor, GarageDoorSensor, MagneticSensor, VibrationSensor and WindowSensor.
A fairly easy implementation as hardware is not included in the project. The focus was on achieving all the requirements.

# What I learned
- Whole software lifecycle - from the software requirements definition and documentation to software implementation and code verification
- Class inheritance
